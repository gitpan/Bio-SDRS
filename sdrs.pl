=head1 NAME

sdrs.pl - Command line script to use Bio::SDRS to run a Signmoidal Dose Response Search.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    sdrs.pl -multiple=1.05 \
            -step=20 \
            -ldose=0.4 \
            -hdose=25000 \
            -trim=0 \
            -outdir=results \
            data/OVCAR4_HCS_avg.txt

=head1 OPTIONS

=over
    
=item -multiple=<float>

Specifies the multiplicity factor for increasing the dose during the
search. It must be greater than one.

=item -ldose=<float>

Specifies the minimum dose for the search. Must be greater than zero.

=item -hdose=<float>

Specifies the maximum dose for the search. Must be greater than the C<ldose> above.

=item -step=<float>

This value specifies the maximum change in doses in the
search. In the search process, this module starts at the ldose
value. It tries multiplying the current dose by the C<multiple> value,
but it will only increase the dose by no more than the C<step> value
specified here.  It must be positive.

=item -maxproc=<integer>

Specifies the maximum number of processes to be used in the search. 

=item -trim=<float>

This value specifies the proportion of assays to be omitted in the analysis.

First, the maximal response across the doses is calculated for every
assay. Then, assays with lower response will be removed from the
analysis by this factor. Must be a real number between zero and one,
where a value of zero (default) means all assays will be analyzed, and
one means none.

This factor is useful when the SDRS result will be fed into a multiple
test correction procedure such as a false discovery rate (FDR)
algorithm. For example, for genome-scale transcriptional dose response
data, a non-zero value is suggested to remove non-expressed
transcripts, which not only speeds up the process, but also improves
the FDR output.

=item -outdir=<directory>

Specifies the directory where the results are written. If this
directory does not exist, it is created.

=item -[no]debug

Controls display of debugging information. Normally should be left off.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program provides a simple command line interface to the C<Bio::SDRS> Perl module.

=head1 INPUT FILE

There is only one input file to this script which is meant to provide
the data for a number of assays. The file provides the doses of compound
used in the experiment, and it provides the measurements for each dose
for every assay. The file uses Tab Separated Value (TSV) format,
with each value separated from each other using the Tab character
(ASCII code 9).

The first line of the input file must contain the doses as floating
point numbers, with a comment word as the first word. For example, the
following line would describe a eight dose experiment.

Dose	0.42	1.27	3.81	11.43	34.29 	102.88	308.64	925.92	

The succeeding lines of the input file are the measured responses for
each assay, with no limit to the number of assays. The
first word in each line is the assay name, and the remaining
lines are the responses for each dose as specified in the dose line at
the top of the file, and in the same order. Here is an example
response line consistent with the dose example above:

Caspase3	2.1	1.695	1.675	1.735	1.56	1.77	2.34	2.595

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

The output files are written to the directory specified by the C<outdir> option above. The names are composed in part from the options:

=head2 sdrs.C<multiple>.C<step>.out

This file contains the best (local) fitting model at every search dose
for every assay.  Each line is a tab separated value containing the
assay name, search dose, F-score for the best fit at the dose and
corresponding A, B, and D values.

=head2 sdrs.C<multiple>.C<step>.EC50.out

This file contains the estimated EC50 data for each assay in the input file as a
tab separated record. The columns are as follows:

 1  assay name
 2  MAX         Maximum F score
 3  MIN         Minimum F score
 4  LOW         Lower bound of 95% confidence interval for the estimated EC50. 
 5  HIGH        Upper bound of 95% confidence interval for the estimated EC50.
 6  EC50        estimated EC50.
 7  PVALUE      P value of the best fitting model
 8  EC50RANGE   range of 95% confidence interval for the estimated EC50.
 9  PEAK        Number of peaks in the F scores at search doses across experimental dose range.
10  A           estimated value for A in the best model.
11  B           estimated value for B in the best model.
12  D           estimated value for D in the best model.
13  FOLD        Ratio of B/A or 99999.0 if a == 0. Positive if D < 0, negative otherwise.

=head2 sdrs.sorted_probes.out

For every calculated dose in the search, list the assays in order
of F score. Each line in this file is a TSV record where the first
field is the calculated dose, and the remaining fields are the
assay names.

=head2 sdrs.pval_FDR.out

For every calculated dose in the search, list the P Values for fit for
the assays in order of F score exactly in the same order as the
sdrs.sorted_probes.out file.  Each line in this file is a TSV record
where the first field is the calculated dose, and the remaining fields
are the assay names. This file is meant to be used in conjunction
with the sdrs.sorted_probes.out file.
